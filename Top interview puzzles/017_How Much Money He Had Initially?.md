Objective: Determine the initial amount of money the person had in his pocket before visiting the four churches, given that his money doubled upon entering each church and he donated $100 at each church, ending with an empty pocket after the fourth church visit.

Concept: Use algebraic equations to represent the money the person had at each stage of visiting the churches, considering the doubling of money upon entering each church and the $100 donation at each church.

Steps:
1. Let's assume the person started with X dollars in his pocket.
2. Upon entering the first church, his money doubled to 2X, and he donated $100, leaving him with 2X - 100 dollars.
3. Entering the second church, his money doubled again to 2(2X - 100) = 4X - 200, and he donated $100, leaving him with 4X - 300 dollars.
4. Entering the third church, his money doubled again to 2(4X - 300) = 8X - 600, and he donated $100, leaving him with 8X - 700 dollars.
5. Entering the fourth church, his money doubled once more to 2(8X - 700) = 16X - 1400, and he donated $100, leaving him with 16X - 1500 dollars.
6. Since he ended up with an empty pocket after the fourth church, the equation becomes 16X - 1500 = 0.
7. Solve for X to find the initial amount of money.

Explanation:
- The initial amount of money is represented by X dollars.
- At each church visit, his money doubles and then he donates $100, leading to a decrease in the amount of money left.
- The final equation 16X - 1500 = 0 represents the fact that he ended up with zero money after the fourth church visit.

Result: Solving the equation 16X - 1500 = 0 gives X = 93.75. Hence, the person had initially started his quest with $93.75 in his pocket.
