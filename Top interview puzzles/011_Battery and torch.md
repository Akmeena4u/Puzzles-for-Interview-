**Objective:** Determine the fewest number of pairs of batteries needed to test to guarantee that the torch can be turned on.

**Concept:**
- The torch requires two working batteries to function.
- Out of eight batteries, only four are working.
- We need to find an efficient way to test the batteries to ensure we have a pair of working batteries.

**Steps:**
1. Group the batteries into three groups: Group 1 with three batteries (B1, B2, B3), Group 2 with three batteries (B4, B5, B6), and Group 3 with two batteries (B7, B8).
2. Since there are four working batteries, there must be at least one group that contains two working batteries.
3. Calculate the possible combinations for each group:
   - Group 1 (B1, B2, B3): Possible combinations are B1+B2, B1+B3, B2+B3 (total 3 combinations).
   - Group 2 (B4, B5, B6): Possible combinations are B4+B5, B4+B6, B5+B6 (total 3 combinations).
   - Group 3 (B7, B8): Only one combination is possible, either B7+B8 or B8+B7.
4. Since at least one group has two working batteries, any combination from that group will work.
5. Add up the total combinations from all three groups: 3 (Group 1) + 3 (Group 2) + 1 (Group 3) = 7 possible trials.
6. Therefore, the fewest number of pairs of batteries needed to test to guarantee the torch can be turned on is 7 pairs.

**Conclusion:** By grouping the batteries into three groups and calculating the possible combinations within each group, we can guarantee that the torch can be turned on with the fewest number of trials, which is 7 pairs of batteries.
