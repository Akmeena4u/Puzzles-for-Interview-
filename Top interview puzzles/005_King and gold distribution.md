### Puzzle: King and Gold Distribution

**Objective:** 
As a king, pay a servant working all seven days in gold bars, making only two breaks in the gold bar. The servant works equal time each day, and thus equal amounts must be paid daily.

**Concepts Utilized:**

1. **Transaction Strategy:**
   - Make strategic transactions with the servant using two cuts on the gold bar to create specific sizes of bars.

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **Initial Cuts (1/7, 2/7, 4/7):**
   - Make two cuts on the gold bar to create three bars:
     - Bar A: 1/7 of the original bar.
     - Bar B: 2/7 of the original bar.
     - Bar C: 4/7 of the original bar.

2. **Daily Transactions:**
   - **Day 1:**
     - Give Bar A (1/7) to the worker.
     - Remain with Bar B (2/7) and Bar C (4/7).
   - **Day 2:**
     - Give Bar B (2/7) to the worker.
     - Take back Bar A (1/7).
     - Remain with Bar A (1/7) and Bar C (4/7).
   - **Day 3:**
     - Give Bar A (1/7) to the worker.
     - Remain with Bar B (2/7) and Bar C (4/7).
   - **Day 4:**
     - Give Bar C (4/7) to the worker.
     - Take back Bar A (1/7) and Bar B (2/7).
     - Remain with Bar A (1/7) and Bar B (2/7).
   - **Day 5:**
     - Give Bar A (1/7) to the worker.
     - Remain with Bar B (2/7) and Bar C (4/7).
   - **Day 6:**
     - Give Bar B (2/7) to the worker.
     - Take back Bar A (1/7).
     - Remain with Bar A (1/7) and Bar C (4/7).
   - **Day 7:**
     - Give Bar A (1/7) to the worker.
     - Remain with no bars.
  
**Summary:**
By strategically making transactions with the servant using two cuts on the gold bar to create specific sizes of bars, the servant can be paid equal amounts daily for seven days, fulfilling the payment requirement while making only two breaks in the gold bar.
