### Objective:
Determine which cake is poisonous using John's responses.

### Concept:
Utilize a logical approach to narrow down the options based on John's answers.

### Steps:
1. **Assumption 1: Allowed to Cut the Cake**
   - Assume three cake pieces labeled A, B, and C.
   - Cut cake C into equal portions C1 and C2.
   - Pair C1 with A and C2 with B, creating segments AC1 and BC2.
   - Ask John if AC1 is more poisonous than BC2.
   - If John says yes, discard A as poisonous and keep B, C1, and C2.
   - If John says no, either A is less poisonous than B or C2 is more poisonous. In this case, discard A and keep B, C1, and C2.

### Result:
Through logical deduction and John's responses, it is possible to identify the non-poisonous cake(s). However, determining the exact poisonous cake may require additional steps or information.

This solution highlights a strategic approach to solving the puzzle while considering different scenarios and interpretations.
