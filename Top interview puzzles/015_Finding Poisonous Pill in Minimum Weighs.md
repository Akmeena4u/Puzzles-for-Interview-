Sure, here's the answer structured in the requested format:

**Objective:**
Identify the slightly heavier poisonous pill among eight pills using a balanced scale, with only two weighings allowed.

**Concept:**
Utilizing the balanced scale to compare groups of pills to determine which group contains the poisonous pill, and then narrowing down to the specific pill using a second weighing if necessary.

**Steps:**

1. **Grouping Pills:**
   - Split the eight pills into three groups: Group 1 (1-2-3), Group 2 (4-5-6), and Group 3 (7-8).

2. **First Weighing:**
   - Weigh Group 1 against Group 2.
     - If one group is heavier, move to Second Weighing with that group.
     - If they balance, the poisonous pill is in Group 3.

3. **Second Weighing (if needed):**
   - If the heavier group was determined in the First Weighing, proceed with Second Weighing.
   - Weigh two pills from the heavier group against each other and keep one aside.
     - If one side is heavier, that pill is the poisonous one.
     - If they balance, the unweighed pill from the heavier group is the poisonous one.

**Conclusion:**
By following these steps, the poisonous pill can be identified with only two weighings on the balanced scale.
