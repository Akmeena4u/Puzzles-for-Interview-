### Puzzle: Jelly Bean Labeling

**Objective:** 
Correctly label three jars, one containing candies, one containing sweets, and one containing a mixture of candies and sweets, with mislabeled jars.

**Concepts Utilized:**

1. **Logical Deduction:**
   - Use the information from picking an eatable from one jar to deduce the correct labels for all three jars.

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **First Pick (Jar C):**
   - Pick one eatable from jar C (labeled as candies and sweets).
   - If it's a candy, then jar C contains only candies because it's mislabeled.
   - This information is enough to label the other two jars correctly:
     - Jar A must contain sweets (since jar C has only candies).
     - Jar B must contain the mixture of candies and sweets (since jar B is mislabeled as sweets).

**Summary:**
By picking just one eatable from jar C and deducing the correct labels based on the mislabeling, all three jars can be correctly labeled with candies, sweets, and a mixture of candies and sweets.

### Variation: Apple and Oranges Labeling

**Objective:** 
Correctly label three jars, one containing apples, one containing oranges, and one containing a mixture of apples and oranges, with mislabeled jars.

**Concepts Utilized:**

1. **Logical Deduction:**
   - Use the information from picking a fruit from one jar to deduce the correct labels for all three jars.

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **First Pick (Jar Apple and Oranges):**
   - Pick one fruit from the jar labeled as apple and oranges.
   - If it's an apple, then the jar labeled as apple and oranges is mislabeled as it should only contain apples.
   - Thus, jar Apple and Oranges must be the apple jar.
   - The jar labeled oranges must contain the mixture, and the jar labeled apples must contain oranges.

**Summary:**
By picking just one fruit from the jar labeled as apple and oranges and deducing the correct labels based on the mislabeling, all three jars can be correctly labeled with apples, oranges, and a mixture of apples and oranges.
