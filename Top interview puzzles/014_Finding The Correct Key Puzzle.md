**Objective:**
Determine the number of attempts needed to figure out the correct key for each of three different gates.

**Concept:**
Understand two interpretations of the puzzle: one is to identify the correct key for each gate and open it, and the other is simply to identify the correct key associated with each gate.

**Steps for the First Interpretation: Identifying Keys and Opening Gates:**

1. **First Lock:**
   - Attempt all three keys.
     - If the last key works, it takes three attempts.
  
2. **Second Lock:**
   - Use the remaining two keys.
     - If one key works, it takes two attempts.

3. **Third Lock:**
   - Use the remaining key.
     - It will work on the first attempt.

**Total Attempts for First Interpretation:**
3 attempts for the first lock + 2 attempts for the second lock + 1 attempt for the third lock = 6 attempts.

**Steps for the Second Interpretation: Identifying Correct Keys:**

1. **First Lock:**
   - Try two keys.
     - If neither works, the third key must be correct.
     - Maximum attempts for the first lock are 2.

2. **Second Lock:**
   - Try the remaining key.
     - It should open the lock on the first attempt.

3. **Third Lock:**
   - Only one key left, which is the correct key for this lock.
     - No attempts needed.

**Total Attempts for Second Interpretation:**
Maximum attempts for the first lock (2) + maximum attempts for the second lock (1) + maximum attempts for the third lock (0) = 3 attempts.

**Conclusion:**
For the first interpretation (identifying keys and opening gates), it takes a maximum of 6 attempts. For the second interpretation (identifying correct keys), it takes a maximum of 3 attempts.
