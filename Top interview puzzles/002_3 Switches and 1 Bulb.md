### Solution to the Puzzle: Determining the Switch for the Bulb

**Objective:** 
Identify which of the three switches corresponds to a bulb in the next room by entering the room a minimum number of times.

**Minimum Number of Entries Required:**
- You only need to enter the room once.

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Turn on the first switch.
   - Wait for about 5-10 minutes. This will allow the bulb, if connected to the first switch, to heat up.
   
2. **Switch Operation:**
   - After waiting, turn off the first switch.
   - Turn on the second switch.

3. **Enter the Room:**
   - Enter the room where the bulb is located.

4. **Observation:**
   - **If the bulb is glowing:**
     - The bulb is connected to the second switch.
   - **If the bulb is not glowing:**
     - Touch the bulb to feel if it is warm:
       - **Warm Bulb:** The bulb is connected to the first switch because it was on for some time and has residual heat.
       - **Cool Bulb:** The bulb is connected to the third switch since it was never turned on.

**Summary:**
- **Glowing bulb:** Second switch.
- **Non-glowing, warm bulb:** First switch.
- **Non-glowing, cool bulb:** Third switch.
