### Puzzle: 17 Minutes Bridge Crossing

**Objective:** 
Cross four people over a dangerous bridge at night using only one torch, ensuring no one risks their life in the dark. The bridge can hold only two people at a time, and each person takes different times to cross: 1 minute, 2 minutes, 7 minutes, and 10 minutes.

**Concepts Utilized:**

1. **Optimal Pairing:**
   - Pairing individuals with similar crossing times reduces the total time taken.

2. **Strategic Use of Torch:**
   - The torch must be brought back after each crossing to ensure everyone crosses safely.

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **First Crossing (2 + 2 = 4 minutes):**
   - Person taking 1 minute and person taking 2 minutes cross together.
   - Person taking 2 minutes returns with the torch.
   - Time taken: 2 + 2 = 4 minutes.

2. **Second Crossing (10 + 1 = 11 minutes):**
   - Person taking 7 minutes and person taking 10 minutes cross together.
   - Person taking 1 minute (already on the other side) returns with the torch.
   - Time taken: 10 + 1 = 11 minutes.

3. **Final Crossing (2 minutes):**
   - Person taking 1 minute and person taking 2 minutes cross together again.
   - Time taken: 2 minutes.

**Total Time Taken:**
   - 4 minutes (First crossing) + 11 minutes (Second crossing) + 2 minutes (Final crossing) = 17 minutes.

Alternatively, the same time can be achieved with a different sequence:
   - 1 minute + 2 minutes cross first, then 7 minutes + 10 minutes cross.
   - 2 minutes (returns) + 1 minute cross, then 1 minute + 2 minutes cross again.

**Summary:**
By strategically pairing individuals and ensuring the torch is brought back after each crossing, the shortest time of 17 minutes can be achieved for all four people to cross the bridge safely at night.
