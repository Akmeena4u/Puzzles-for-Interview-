### Objective:
Determine the initial number of chocolates each for John and Peter based on their selling rates and combined sales.

### Concept:
Utilize the rates at which John and Peter sell chocolates separately and together to derive the initial quantities.

### Steps:
1. **Assumption 1: Initial Chocolates**
   - Assume John and Peter each have X chocolates initially.

2. **Money Earned by John and Peter Separately:**
   - John sells at 2 pieces per rupee, so money earned by John = X/2.
   - Peter sells at 3 pieces per rupee, so money earned by Peter = X/3.
   - Total money earned separately = X/2 + X/3.

3. **Money Earned by Selling Together:**
   - Combined, they have 2X chocolates.
   - Selling at 5 pieces for 2 rupees means 5 chocolates are considered as one piece sold for 2 rupees, which is 5/2.
   - Total money earned selling together = 2X / (5/2) = 4X/5.

4. **Equation and Solution:**
   - Set up the equation: X/2 + X/3 = 4X/5 + 7 (7 rupees less than selling separately).
   - Solve the equation for X to find the initial number of chocolates each had, which is 210 chocolates.

### Result:
John and Peter each initially had 210 chocolates, leading to the observed earnings and shortfall in combined sales compared to selling separately.

This solution outlines the calculation process step by step, enabling the determination of the initial quantities of chocolates for John and Peter.
