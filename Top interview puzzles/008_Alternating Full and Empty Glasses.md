### Puzzle: Alternating Full and Empty Glasses

**Objective:** 
Move one glass to create a row of alternately full and empty glasses.

**Given:**
- Three glasses on the left are full (A, B, C).
- Three glasses on the right are empty (D, E, F).
- You can only move one glass.

**Solution:**

1. **Current Setup:**
   - A, B, C (Full)
   - D, E, F (Empty)

2. **Move Glass B:**
   - Pour the contents of Glass B (full) into Glass E (empty).
   - Now, Glass B is empty, and Glass E is full.

3. **Resulting Setup:**
   - A, C (Full)
   - B, D, F (Empty)
   - E (Full)

By creatively interpreting the rules and making use of the absence of restrictions on operations, you can move Glass B to create a row of alternately full and empty glasses.
