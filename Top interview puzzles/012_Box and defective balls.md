**Objective:** Identify the box containing defective balls among 10 boxes where each ball is supposed to weigh 10 grams but the defective balls weigh 9 grams.

**Concept:**
- Use the fact that each box corresponds to a number (from 1 to 10) and take a different number of balls from each box equal to its box number.
- Calculate the expected total weight of the balls based on the assumption that all balls are good (10 grams each).
- The difference between the actual total weight and the expected total weight will indicate the box number containing defective balls.

**Steps:**
1. Label the boxes from 1 to 10.
2. Take one ball from Box 1, two balls from Box 2, three balls from Box 3, and so on until 10 balls from Box 10. This gives a total of 55 balls.
3. Calculate the expected total weight if all balls are good:  1 + 2 + 3 + .... + 10  (sum of numbers from 1 to 10) multiplied by 10 grams (weight of each ball), which is 550 grams.
4. Weigh the 55 balls on the electronic weighing machine. Let's say the actual weight is X grams.
5. Calculate the difference between the expected weight (550 grams) and the actual weight (X grams): Difference = 550 - X.
6. The value of the difference represents the box number containing defective balls, as each defective ball weighs 9 grams instead of 10 grams.

**Example:**
- If the actual weight of the 55 balls is 547 grams, then the difference is  550 - 547 = 3 grams.
- This indicates that Box 3 contains defective balls, as the weight is 3 grams less than expected (3 balls weighing 9 grams each).

**Conclusion:** By following this method and calculating the difference in weights, we can accurately identify the box containing defective balls using the electronic weighing machine only once.
