### Puzzle: Fox, Chicken, and Corn Crossing

**Objective:** 
Cross a fox, a chicken, and a bag of corn across a river using a small boat without leaving the fox alone with the chicken or the chicken alone with the corn, as they will eat each other.

**Concepts Utilized:**

1. **Strategic Planning:**
   - Plan the sequence of items to transport to ensure nothing gets eaten during the crossings.

**Steps to Solve:**

1. **First Crossing (Chicken):**
   - Farmer takes the chicken across the river, leaving the fox and corn together on the starting side.
   - Reason: The fox will not eat the corn.

2. **Second Crossing (Fox):**
   - Farmer returns and takes the fox across the river to the other side.
   - Instead of leaving the fox with the chicken (risking the chicken getting eaten), the farmer swaps them out and brings the chicken back to the starting side.
  
3. **Third Crossing (Corn):**
   - Farmer leaves the chicken on the starting side and takes the corn across the river.
   - The fox and corn are left alone on the far side.

4. **Final Crossing (Chicken):**
   - Farmer goes back to get the chicken and brings it across the river.
   - Now, all three items (fox, chicken, and corn) are safely on the far side.

**Summary:**
By strategically planning the crossings and ensuring that the fox, chicken, and corn are never left alone together in a way that could result in one of them getting eaten, the farmer successfully brings all three items across the river without any losses.
