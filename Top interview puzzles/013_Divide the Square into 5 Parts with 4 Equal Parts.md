**Objective:** Divide a square into five parts such that four of these parts are equal in size without lifting the pen.

**Solution:**
1. **Draw a square:** Start by drawing a square. This square will be the outer boundary of our divisions.
2. **Inscribe a circle:** Draw a circle inside the square such that it touches all four sides of the square. This circle will be inscribed within the square.
3. **Divide the square:** Now, with the circle inscribed, you'll notice that the square is automatically divided into five parts.
   - Part 1: The central area inside the circle.
   - Part 2: The top left corner outside the circle.
   - Part 3: The top right corner outside the circle.
   - Part 4: The bottom left corner outside the circle.
   - Part 5: The bottom right corner outside the circle.
4. **Equal parts:** The four outer parts (Parts 2, 3, 4, and 5) are equal because the circle inscribed inside the square makes their sizes identical.

**Conclusion:** By inscribing a circle inside the square, you can effortlessly divide the square into five parts with four of them being equal in size, meeting the condition without lifting the pen. This solution is efficient and elegant for the given puzzle.
