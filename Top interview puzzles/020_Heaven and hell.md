**Puzzle: Heaven and Hell**

- **Scenario**: Two gates, one to heaven and one to hell, with two gatekeepers, one always truthful and the other always lying. The gatekeepers' identities are unknown.
  
- **Objective**: Determine the gate to heaven using only one question.
  
- **Question**: “If I were to ask the other gatekeeper which gate leads to heaven, what would they say?”

- **Solution**:
  - If the question is asked to the truthful gatekeeper:
    - They would truthfully indicate what the lying gatekeeper would say.
    - Since the lying gatekeeper would falsely point to hell, the truthful gatekeeper would also point to hell.
  - If the question is asked to the lying gatekeeper:
    - They would lie about what the truthful gatekeeper would say.
    - Knowing that the truthful gatekeeper would truthfully point to heaven, the lying gatekeeper would falsely point to hell.
  - In both cases, the answer received would be the gate to hell.
  
- **Conclusion**:
  - Choosing the other gate, which is the gate pointed to by the answer received, leads to the gate to heaven.
