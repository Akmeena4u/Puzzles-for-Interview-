**Objective:** Determine the largest number of dots a circle can pass through in a square grid comprising 25 dots.

**Concept:**
- The circle can pass through dots on the grid based on its size and position.
- To maximize the number of dots passed through, the circle should intersect dots along the sides of the square grid.

**Steps:**
1. Visualize the square grid comprising 25 dots in a 5x5 arrangement.
2. Observe that the circle can intersect dots along the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the grid.
3. Place the circle such that it intersects two dots on each side of the grid.
4. By positioning the circle in this manner, it passes through a total of 8 dots: 2 dots each on the top, bottom, left, and right sides.
5. This arrangement results in the largest number of dots (8) that the circle can pass through.

**Conclusion:** The largest number of dots the circle can pass through in the 25-dots grid is 8, with 2 dots intersected on each of the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the square grid.
