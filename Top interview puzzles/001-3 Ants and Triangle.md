### Ants on a Triangle Puzzle

**Objective**: Find the probability that three ants, starting from the vertices of an equilateral triangle and moving along the perimeter at the same speed, do not collide.

#### Solution Steps:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - Each ant can move either clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW).
   - The ants move with the same speed.

2. **Conditions for No Collision**:
   - All ants move in the same direction (either all CW or all CCW).

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - Each ant has 2 options (CW or CCW).
   - Probability of one ant choosing a specific direction = \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - For all ants to move CCW: `\( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \)`.
   - For all ants to move CW: \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \).

4. **Total Probability**:
   - Probability of no collision = Probability of all CCW + Probability of all CW = \( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \).

#### Final Result:
The probability that the ants will not collide is \( \frac{1}{4} \) or 0.25.

#### Key Points:
- **Uniform Movement**: Assumes ants move uniformly in speed.
- **Equilateral Triangle**: Assumes distances between vertices are equal.
- **Same Speed**: Ensures they move at the same rate along the perimeter.
- **Non-collision Conditions**: Only when all ants move in the same direction (CW or CCW).

#### Conclusion:
The probability that three ants starting at the vertices of an equilateral triangle and moving along the perimeter will not collide is 0.25. This is because there are only two scenarios (all CW or all CCW) where they will avoid collision.
